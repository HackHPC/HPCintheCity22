                The HPC in the City: Dallas Hackathon will Kick-Off on the evening of November 3rd, 2022 with a session in which team mentors will pitch ideas. Student participants will then choose the idea on which they want to work during the event. Each group will contain a mentor, co-mentor, and three (3) to five (5) students. From November 4th-6th, 2022 there will be two(2) “Check-ins” per day.

Finally, on the evening of November 7th, 2022 the teams will present their results. A series of equally ranked prizes will be awarded including Viewer’s Choice Award, Judges Award, and HPC in the City Impact Award.
